IMPORTANCE means the level of criticity of the error: High, Medium, Low


ERROR:
JRE 32 bits.

OUTPUT:
Error loading library. /afs/in2p3.fr/home/g/gomez/jtreqs-server/bin/libHPSSJNIBridge.so: /afs/in2p3.fr/home/g/gomez/jtreqs-server/bin/libHPSSJNIBridge.so: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64 (Possible cause: architecture word width mismatch)

LOCATION:
Standard output or logs at startup.

IMPORTANCE:
High.

DESCRIPTION:
The Java Runtime environment that is currently used is not compatible with the
Native library to access HPSS. The library is compiled in 64 bits.
Please, check that your current JRE is also 64 bits and not 32 bits.
This is important to communicate with HPSS. The native library is compiled in
64 bits, then, it is necessary to run the java virtual machine in 64 bits.

SOLUTION:
Try to reload the environment calling the script:
java6_env
This script will load a good JRE to execute the application.

ERROR:
Logback cannot write in the destination file

OUTPUT:
ERROR in ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.RollingFileAppender[TraceFile] - openFile(/var/log/jtreqs/jtreqs-trace.log,true) call failed.java.io.FileNotFoundException: /var/log/jtreqs/jtreqs-trace.log (Permission denied)
    at java.io.FileNotFoundException: /var/log/jtreqs/jtreqs-trace.log (Permission denied)
    at  at java.io.FileOutputStream.openAppend(Native Method)

LOCATION:
Standard output or logs at startup.

IMPORTANCE:
Medium.

DESCRIPTION:
The application is trying to writes the logs in a location where it does not
have enough rights to write.
The application can continue to work, but there will not be any log in disk,
just in the console (standard output) and this will be difficult in order to
detect any problem.

SOLUTION:
Try to change the rights of the directory or existing files, in order to permit
the user that is executing the application can write there.

OR

Modify the loback.xml file changing the directory for the output of both log
files.
This file can be found at {app-ins}/etc

ERROR:
There are not drives defined in the database.

OUTPUT:
WARN  f.i.c.s.t.p.m.d.MySQLConfigurationDAO - No drives (media type) found. Please define them in the database.

LOCATION:
Standard output or logs.

IMPORTANCE:
High.

DESCRIPTION:
The database contains the information of the quantity of drives per type are
available for the application. This information is vital to select a queue
(a tape) and activate it (mount the tape in a drive). Without this information,
the application will not activate any tape, then, the files will not be staged.

SOLUTION:
Insert in the database the available drives for the application. This can be
done via:

INSERT INTO jmediatypes VALUES ('1', 'T10K-A', 5);

-----

ERROR:
There are not drive allocations defined in the database.

OUTPUT:
WARN  f.i.c.s.t.p.m.d.MySQLConfigurationDAO - No media type allocations found. Please define them in the database.

LOCATION:
Standard output or logs.

IMPORTANCE:
High.

DESCRIPTION:
In order to work the application with fair-share, there must be defined in the
database the minimal quantity of drives per user.
Without this information, the fair-share is not possible, and all users will
have treated in the same way, all of them are equal.

SOLUTION:
Insert in the database the corresponding allocation per user. This can be done
like this:

INSERT INTO jallocations VALUES (1, 'atlagrid', 0.2);

The last column is the percentage of the total quantity of drives that are
reserved for that user.

-----

ERROR:
A media type defined in the database has not defined users for fair-share

OUTPUT:
INFO  f.i.c.s.t.c.activator.Activator - This media type has not defined users: id X

LOCATION:
Standard output or logs.

IMPORTANCE:
Low.

DESCRIPTION:
The fair-share needs two components, drives and users. Both of them are defined
in the database, however, it could be possible to define drives to be used
without fair-share. Then, this message is completely normal.
However, one of the main objective of this application is to use the drives in
a fair-share fashion, so it is better to check if that type of drive should not
have users in the table jallocations.

SOLUTION:
If it is necessary to use fair-share, then register the user in the database:

INSERT INTO jallocations VALUES (2, 'cmsrid', 0.3);

-----

ERROR:
The database connection has not been established or it was lost.

OUTPUT:
WARN  f.i.c.s.t.p.mysql.MySQLBroker - The connection has not been established. Reestablishing the connection.

LOCATION:
Standard output or logs.

IMPORTANCE:
Low.

DESCRIPTION:
The application has a mechanism to detect if the database connection was not
established, or it was lost, then it retries to connect to it.

SOLUTION:
Nothing, the application is designed to recover from this problem.

-----

ERROR:
The given credentials in the configuration file do not permit to connect to
the database.

OUTPUT:
SQLException: Communications link failure

The last packet sent successfully to the server was 0 milliseconds ago. The driver has not received any packets from the server.

VendorError: 0
fr.in2p3.cc.storage.treqs.persistence.mysql.exception.MySQLOpenException: com.mysql.jdbc.exceptions.jdbc4.CommunicationsException: Communications link failure

The last packet sent successfully to the server was 0 milliseconds ago. The driver has not received any packets from the server.

LOCATION:
Standard output or logs at startup.

IMPORTANCE:
High.

DESCRIPTION:
The given credentials in the configuration file (jtreqs.conf.properties) are
not valid to connect to the given database. The applications cannot connect to
the data source and this is vital to function.

SOLUTION:
Please check the connectivity to the indicated database with the given
credentials and change the configuration with the proper ones.

-----

ERROR:
The database server is not available.

OUTPUT:
SQLException: Access denied for user 'treqs'@'localhost' (using password: YES)

DESCRIPTION:
The given database seems online.

SOLUTION:
Try to connect to the given database with the given credentials and correct
the configuration file if necessary (jtreqs.conf.properties).
