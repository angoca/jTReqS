    <h2>What is an encoder</h2>

    <p>Encoders are responsible for transforming an event into a byte
    array as well as writing out that byte array into an
    <code>OutputStream</code>. Encoders were introduced in logback
    version 0.9.19. In previous versions, most appenders relied on a
    layout to transform an event into a string and write it out using
    a <code>java.io.Writer</code>. In previous versions of logback,
    users would nest a <code>PatternLayout</code> within
    <code>FileAppender</code>. As for logback 0.9.19,
    <code>FileAppender</code> and sub-classes <a
    href="../codes.html#layoutInsteadOfEncoder">expect an encoder and no
    longer admit a layout</a>.
    </p>

    <p>Why the breaking change?
    </p>

    <p>Layouts, as discussed in detail in the next chapter, are only
    able to transform an event into a String. Moreover, given that a
    layout has no control over when events get written out, layouts
    cannot aggregate events into batches. Contrast this with encoders
    which not only have total control over the format of the bytes
    written out, also control when (and if) those bytes get written
    out.
    </p>

    <p>At present time (2010-03-08), <code>PatternLayotEncoder</code>
    is the only really useful encoder. It merely wraps a
    <code>PatternLayout</code> which does most of the work. Thus, may
    seem that encoders do not bring much to the table except needless
    complexity. However, we hope that with the advent of new and
    powerful encoders this impression will change.</p>

    <h2><a name="interface" href="#interface">Encoder
    interface</a></h2>

    <p>Encoders are responsible for transforming an incoming event
    into a byte array <b>and</b> writing out the resulting byte array
    onto the appropriate OutputStream.  Thus, encoders have total
    control of what and when bytes gets written to the
    <code>OutputStream</code> maintained by the owning appender. Here
    is the <a
    href="../xref/ch/qos/logback/core/encoder/Encoder.html">Encoder
    interface:</a>
   
    </p>
    <pre class="prettyprint source">package ch.qos.logback.core.encoder;

public interface Encoder&lt;E> extends ContextAware, LifeCycle {

   /**
   * This method is called when the owning appender starts or whenever output
   * needs to be directed to a new OutputStream, for instance as a result of a
   * rollover.
   */
  void init(OutputStream os) throws IOException;

  /**
   * Encode and write an event to the appropriate {@link OutputStream}.
   * Implementations are free to differ writing out of the encoded event and
   * instead write in batches.
   */
  void doEncode(E event) throws IOException;


  /**
   * This method is called prior to the closing of the underling
   * {@link OutputStream}. Implementations MUST not close the underlying
   * {@link OutputStream} which is the responsibility of the owning appender.
   */
  void close() throws IOException;
}</pre>

    <p>As you can see, the Encoder interface consists of few method
    but surprisingly enough many useful things can be accomplished with
    those methods.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="LayoutWrappingEncoder"
    href="#LayoutWrappingEncoder">LayoutWrappingEncoder</a></h2>

    <p>Until logback version 0.9.19, appenders which offered
    flexibility with respect to the output format relied on
    layouts. As there exists a substantial body of code based on the
    layout interface, we need a way for encoders inter-operate with
    layouts. <a
    href="../xref/ch/qos/logback/core/encoder/LayoutWrappingEncoder.html">LayoutWrappingEncoder</a>
    bridges the gap between encoders and layouts. It implements the
    encoder interface and wraps a layout to which it delegates the
    work of transforming an event into string.
    </p>

    <p>Below is an excerpt from the <code>LayoutWrappingEncoder</code>
    class illustrating how delegation to the wrapped layout instance
    is done.</p>

 <pre class="prettyprint source">package ch.qos.logback.core.encoder;

public class LayoutWrappingEncoder&lt;E> extends EncoderBase&lt;E> {

  protected Layout&lt;E> layout;
  private Charset charset;

  public void doEncode(E event) throws IOException {
    String txt = layout.doLayout(event);
    outputStream.write(convertToBytes(txt));
    outputStream.flush();
  }

  private byte[] convertToBytes(String s) {
    if (charset == null) {
      return s.getBytes();
    } else {
      return s.getBytes(charset);
    }
  } 
}</pre>

    <p>The <code>doEncode</code>() method starts by having the wrapped
    layout convert the incoming event into string. The resulting text
    string is converted to bytes according to the charset encoding
    chosen by the user. Those bytes are then written to the
    <code>OutputStream</code> given by the owning appender and the
    <code>OutputStream</code> is immediately flushed.
    </p>


    <h2><a name="PatternLayoutEncoder"
    href="#PatternLayoutEncoder">PatternLayoutEncoder</a></h2>

    <p>Given that <code>PatternLayout</code> is the most commonly used
    layout, logback caters for this common use case with
    <code>PatternLayoutEncoder</code>, an extension of
    <code>LayoutWrappingEncoder</code> restricted to wrapping
    instances of <code>PatternLayout</code>.
    </p>

    <p>As of logback version 9.9.19, whenever a
    <code>FileAppender</code> or one of its sub-classes was configured
    with a <code>PatternLayout</code>, a
    <code>PatternLayoutEncoder</code> must be used instead. This is
    explained in the <a
    href="../codes.html#layoutInsteadOfEncoder">relevant entry in the
    logback error codes</a>.
